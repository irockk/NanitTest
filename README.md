## Technologies Used:
Kotlin – Primary language for development <br />
Jetpack Compose – UI framework for building responsive UIs <br />
Coroutines – For asynchronous programming <br />
DataStore – Local storage for user data<br />
Koin (with Koin Annotations) – Dependency injection <br />
Coil - Async images loading  <br />
Capturable - Library to capture a bitmap from a composable <br />

## Architecture: This app follows the MVVM architecture:
ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and handles user actions and business logic. <br />
UseCases: Encapsulate business logic and interact with the data layer. <br />
Repositories: Manage data operations, including user data. <br />

## Notes:
There is no error snackbars for now. Left TODOs for them. <br />

Did not manage to share birthday image without capture photo buton. But now it's shared without cross and share buttons. <br />
